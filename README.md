A button is added below the normal 'Login' button on the Purdue sign in page. This will automatically autofill a one-time-password generated from your BoilerKey and sign in for you!

## Setup
**This setup will create a new BoilerKey Device for you!**

Simply enter your Purdue username and password.
This password may be any acceptable kind that Purdue's own sign in page would accept ("0000,push", "0000,push0", "0000,000000").
If you choose to use a "push" type password, you need to accept the DuoMobile request for the setup to complete.

The setup will take a few seconds to complete. If you click away and close the setup window during this time, it will cancel.

That's all! You're done setting up.

## Usage
<img src="https://imgur.com/xImZmiF.png" width="500">
There is an option for 'Auto Login' which will automatically log in for you once the Purdue login page shows up.
You may also clear data here to remove your data from the extension.

**This will NOT remove the BoilerKey device!**

If you delete the BoilerKey device being used by the extension (`BoilerKey_Chrome` or `BoilerKey_Chrome_XXXX`), it **will stop working!** If you would like to continue using the extension, you can clear data and complete setup again.
